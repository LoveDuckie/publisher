## SilverStripe?

I use SilverStripe as the CMS of choice for my personal website. Unfortunately it doesn't support Markdown out of the box, and therefore requires a bit of scaffolding code. This is why I have additionally created a "target publisher", along with supporting PHP code to enable for this. Use at your own risk!
